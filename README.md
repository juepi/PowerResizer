# PowerResizer

PowerShell script which can rotate, compress and scale down input file images. Its main purpose is to prepare a bunch of Images in a given folder for web-publishing.

**ATTENTION**: always keep in mind that PowerResizer will **always overwrite** your input files! So you probably do **not** want to run this script on the one-and-only-copy of your photo-library!

Uses external Programs for conversions:  
PhotoMolo:  
http://www.ktverkko.fi/~msmakela/software/photomolo/photomolo.html  
ImageMagick:  
https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php  


## DESCRIPTION

Script will optimize common image formats, result will always be a progressive JPG.
Depending on the input file, 2 different optimization parameters will be set
for images larger than a given resolution and images with a smaller resolution.
Define your requirements in script section "User Settings".
Script can work recursively through a given directory, defaults to non-recursive.

**ATTENTION:** this script will overwrite the original files, and also remove non-JPG
input files!! Handle with care!

## PARAMETER InputPath
Input Path might be a single file or a folder.
If InputPath is a Folder, all files with supported extensions will be treated.

## PARAMETER Recurse
Only supported when InputPath is a folder. Work recursively through all subfolders.  
**Handle with care!**

## PARAMETER AddPrefix
Will add the directory name, where the handled photo is located, as file name prefix.  
Files which already start with the new prefix will not be renamed.  
Result will be LEAFDIRNAME + "_" + Original-Filename  
Main purpose is to get some overview in flat WordPress Media library.

## PARAMETER Quality
Alternatively to compress photos to a target file size, you can use this optional param to manually set a desired JPEG compression level.  
Values 0 to 100 are accepted, value 0 is the default which means target file size as defined in "User Settings".

## EXAMPLE

    C:\PS> .\PowerResizer.ps1 -InputPath 'c:\Pics\to convert\convertme.bmp'

## EXAMPLE

    C:\PS> .\PowerResizer.ps1 -InputPath 'c:\Pics\to convert\recursively' -Recurse

## EXAMPLE

    C:\PS> .\PowerResizer.ps1 -InputPath 'c:\Pics\EventXY' -AddPrefix -Quality 80 
Result: Photo "abc.png" in Folder C:\Pics\EventXY will be converted and renamed to "EventXY_abc.jpg" with a JPG Quality value of 80.

## Configuration
For Image size and quality (filesize) settings update the Variables in the "User Settings" section.  
In addition, you will need to make sure that the paths to the required external binaries ("System Settings" section) match your system.  

## HINT

You might want to place a CMD-wrapper script in your "Send To" folder which is located in:  
    `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo`
for recent Windows OSes.  
The Wrapper script should contain (at least):  
    `@powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -file "C:\PathTo\PowerResizer.ps1" %1`

It will allow you to Use the Windows Explorers "Send To" context Menu to send an image file or folder through the PowerResizer.

Have fun,
